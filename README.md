# Windscribe 2.0 Desktop Application

This repo contains the complete source code for the Windscribe 2.0 app. This includes installer, service/helper, and GUI.

## Windows

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11.
- Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). When installing Git, you can stick with all the default options presented to you by the installer.
- Clone the repository.
- Install Visual Studio Community Edition 2019 (run `install_vs.bat` from `/tools/prepare_build_environment/windows`).
- Install Python 3 via either the Microsoft Store or from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  Minimum tested version is 3.6.8.
- Install [Active Perl](https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/downloads/).
    - Alternately, you can install [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/).
- Install CMake v3.23.x or newer from [here](https://cmake.org/download/) (`install_cmake.bat` in `tools/prepare_build_environment/windows` will download and install CMake v3.23.2 for you).
- Verify the following entries are in your System `PATH` environment variable. If they are not, add them to the System `PATH` environment variable and reboot.
    - `C:\Perl64\site\bin` (or equivalent Strawberry Perl `site\bin` folder)
    - `C:\Perl64\bin` (or equivalent Strawberry Perl `bin` folder)
    - `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd`
- Verify that `python3` is available in your System `PATH` environment variable.
  - If you installed Python from the Microsoft Store, enable the `python3.exe` execution alias in System Settings `Manage App Execution Aliases`.
  - If you installed Python from python.org, you can `mklink /path/to/your/python3.exe /path/to/your/python.exe`

### Install build script dependencies
- You will have to go to `Manage App Execution Aliases` in System Settings and disable app installer for `python.exe` and `python3.exe`

```python
  python3 -m pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
```

### Install signing certificate (optional)
- Copy your PFX code signing file to `installer/windows/signing/code_signing.pfx`.
- Edit (create) `tools/notarize.yml` and add the following line:
```
  windows-signing-cert-password: password-for-code-signing-pfx
```
- Edit `client/common/utils/executable_signature/executable_signature_defs.h` and set the `WINDOWS_CERT_SUBJECT_NAME` entry to match your certficate's name of signer field.

### Build libraries

Go to subfolder `tools/deps` and run the following scripts in order. Libraries will be placed in `build-libs`.

```
install_jom
install_openssl
install_openssl_ech_draft
install_qt
install_cares
install_zlib
install_curl
install_boost
install_lzo
install_openvpn
install_wireguard
install_stunnel
```

### Build the Windscribe 2.0 app

Go to subfolder `tools` and run `build_all`. Assuming all goes well with the build, the installer will be placed in `build-exe`.  You can run `build_all --sign --use-local-secrets` for a code-signed build, using the certificate from the [Install signing certificate](#install-signing-certificate-optional) section above, which will perform run-time signature verification checks on the executables.  Note that an unsigned build must be installed on your PC if you intend to debug the project.

See `build_all --help` for other build options.

You will find the application logs in `C:/Users/USER/AppData/Local/Windscribe/Windscribe2`.

## Mac

### Prerequisites

- macOS Big Sur, Monterey, or Ventura
- Install Xcode 13.2.1 (If on Monterey/Ventura, you may use a newer version of Xcode 13/14, but 13.2.1 is the last version to support Big Sur)
    - Note: these downloads will require you to first login to your Apple account.
    - https://download.developer.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_13.2.1/Xcode_13.2.1.xip
- Install brew (brew.sh)
```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
- Install git. This step is optional, as git is bundled with Xcode.
```bash
  brew install git
```
- Install Auto-Tools and 7-Zip:
```bash
  brew install libtool
  brew install automake
  brew install p7zip
```
- Install Python 3:
    - Minimum tested version is Python 3.6.8. You may do this however you like, however `pyenv` is recommended:
```bash
  brew install pyenv
  echo 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then eval "$(pyenv init --path)"; fi"' >> ~/.zshrc
  pyenv install 3.11.0
  pyenv global 3.11.0
```
- Install dmgbuild:
```bash
  python3 -m pip install dmgbuild
```
- Install CMake v3.23.x or newer from [here](https://cmake.org/download/)
- Clone the repository.
- Install python deps:
```python
  python3 -m pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
```

### Install signing certificate (required)
- Install your Developer ID Application signing certificate from your Apple Developer account in Keychain Access.
- Edit `client/common/utils/executable_signature/executable_signature_defs.h` and set the `MACOS_CERT_DEVELOPER_ID` entry to match your Developer ID Application signing certificate.

### Build libraries

Go to subfolder `tools/deps` and run the following scripts in order. Libraries will be placed in `build-libs`.

```
install_openssl
install_openssl_ech_draft
install_qt
install_cares
install_curl
install_boost
install_lzo
install_openvpn
install_wireguard
install_stunnel
```

### Build the Windscribe 2.0 app

Go to subfolder `tools` and run `build_all`. Assuming all goes well with the build, the installer will be placed in `build-exe`.

See `build_all --help` for other build options.

You will find the application logs in `~/Library/Application Support/Windscribe/Windscribe2`.

### Platform Notes:
- If you make any changes to the helper source code `backend/mac/helper/src`, you must increase the `CFBundleVersion` in `backend/mac/helper/src/helper-info.plist`. The installer only updates the helper if this bundle version number has changed.
- The IKEv2 protocol will only function in builds produced by Windscribe.  It's implementation on macOS utilizes the NEVPNManager API, which requires the 'Personal VPN' entitlement (`com.apple.developer.networking.vpn.api`) and an embedded provisioning profile file.  If you wish to enable IKEv2 functionality, you will have to create an embedded provisioning file in your Apple Developer account and use it in the client project (Search for `embedded.provisionprofile` in `client/CMakeLists.txt` for details on where to place the embedded provisioning profile).
