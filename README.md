# Windscribe 2.0 Desktop Application
This repo contains the complete source code for the Windscribe 2.0 app. This includes installer, service/helper, backend process and GUI. 

## Windows
### Prerequisites

- Windows 10.
- Install git (https://git-scm.com/downloads). When installing Git, you can stick with all the default options presented to you by the installer.
- Clone the repository.
- Visual Studio Community 2017 (run install_vs.bat with admin rights from /common/prepare_build_environment/windows).
- Python 2.7x (run install_python.bat with admin rights from common/prepare_build_environment/windows).
- Active Perl (install from https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/downloads/ or execute this code snippet).
    - powershell -Command "& $([scriptblock]::Create((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://platform.activestate.com/dl/cli/w20598w01/install.ps1'))) -activate-default ActiveState/Perl-5.32"
    - Alternately, you can install Strawberry Perl from https://strawberryperl.com/
- CMake (run install_cmake.bat from common/prepare_build_environment/windows).
- CppCheck (run install_cppcheck.bat with admin rights from common/prepare_build_environment/windows).
- Verify the following entries are in your System PATH environment variable. If they are not, add them to the System PATH environment variable.  Reboot.
    - C:\Python27
    - C:\Python27\Scripts
    - C:\Perl64\site\bin (or equivalent Strawberry Perl site\bin folder)
    - C:\Perl64\bin (or equivalent Strawberry Perl bin folder)
    - C:\Program Files\Git\cmd
    - C:\Program Files\Cppcheck

### Install build script dependencies
- On Windows 10, you will have to go to 'Manage App Execution Aliases' in System Settings and disable app installer for python.exe and python3.exe
- python tools/bin/get-pip.py
- python -m pip install -r tools/requirements.txt

### Install signing certificate (optional)
- Copy your PFX code signing file to installer/windows/signing/code_signing.pfx.
- Edit tools/build_all.yml and enter the password for your PFX file in the password_cert field of the windows_signing_cert section.
- Edit common/utils/executable_signature/executable_signature_defs.h and set the WINDOWS_CERT_SUBJECT_NAME entry to match your certficate's name of signer field.

### Build libraries

Go to subfolder tools/deps and run the following scripts in order. Libraries will be placed in build-libs.

- install_jom 
- install_openssl
- install_qt
- install_cares
- install_zlib
- install_curl
- install_boost
- install_lzo
- install_openvpn
- install_wireguard
- install_stunnel
- install_protobuf

#### Notes
- Some libraries depends on others. Jom is installed first and speeds up further builds. Almost all of the libraries depends on openssl. Openvpn depends on LZO. Curl depends on openssl and zlib.
- If you notice install or build scripts fail for seemingly no reason, try running each script from a fresh shell instance (CMD or gitbash). It appears to have something to do with a character limit on PATH or ENV variables.

### Build the Windscribe 2.0 app

Go to subfolder tools and run 'build_all'. Assuming all goes well with the build, the installer will be placed in build-exe.  You can run 'build_all --sign' for a code-signed build, using the certificate from the 'Install signing certificate' section above, which will perform run-time signature verification checks on the executables.  Note that an unsigned build must be installed on your PC if you intend to debug the project using Qt Creator.

See `build_all --help` for other build options.

You will find the application logs in C:/Users/USER/AppData/Local/Windscribe/Windscribe2.

## Mac
### Prerequisites

- MacOS Catalina or MacOS Big Sur (We recommend building/developing only on a native machine. VM setups are not well tested)
- Install brew (brew.sh)
    - /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
- Install Xcode 11.3.1 if using MacOS Catalina, or Xcode 11.7 if using Big Sur
    - Note: these downloads will require you to first login to your Apple account.
    - https://download.developer.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_11.7/Xcode_11.7.xip
    - https://download.developer.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_11.3.1/Xcode_11.3.1.xip
    - The brew install step above will have installed the Xcode command-line tools.  Make sure to run Xcode after installing it, and set the Command Line Tools in Preferences->Locations to the version of Xcode you installed.
- git (https://git-scm.com/downloads). This step is optional, as git is bundled with Xcode.
    - brew install git
- Clone the repository.
- Install Auto-Tools and 7-Zip:
    - brew install libtool
    - brew install automake
    - brew install p7zip
- Install Wireguard build tools (brew install go)
- Install CppCheck (brew install cppcheck)
- Install dmgbuild:
    - python -m pip install dmgbuild
- Install cmake from: https://cmake.org/download/ 
- Install python deps:
    - python tools/bin/get-pip.py
    - python -m pip install -r tools/requirements.txt

### Install signing certificate (required)
- Install your Developer ID Application signing certificate from your Apple Developer account in Keychain Access.
- Edit common/utils/executable_signature/executable_signature_defs.h and set the MACOS_CERT_DEVELOPER_ID entry to match your Developer ID Application signing certificate.

### Build libraries

Go to subfolder tools/deps and run the following scripts in order. Libraries will be placed in build-libs.

- install_openssl
- install_qt
- install_cares
- install_boost
- install_curl
- install_lzo
- install_openvpn
- install_wireguard
- install_stunnel
- install_protobuf
- install_gtest

### Notes on building libraries:
    - Some libraries depends on others. Almost all of the libraries depends on openssl. Openvpn depends on LZO.

### Build the Windscribe 2.0 app

Go to subfolder tools and run 'build_all'. Assuming all goes well with the build, the installer will be placed in build-exe.  You can run 'build_all --sign' for a production build which will perform run-time signature verification checks on the executables.  Note that an unsigned build must be installed on your Mac if you intend to debug the project using Qt Creator.

See `build_all --help` for other build options.

You will find the application logs in ~/Library/Application Support/Windscribe/Windscribe2.

### Platform Notes:
    - If you make any changes to the helper source code (backend/mac/helper/src), you must increase the CFBundleVersion in backend/mac/helper/src/helper-info.plist. The installer only updates the helper if this bundle version number has changed.
    - The IKEv2 protocol will only function in builds produced by Windscribe.  It's implementation on MacOS utilizes the NEVPNManager API, which requires the 'Personal VPN' entitlement (com.apple.developer.networking.vpn.api) and an embedded provisioning profile file.  If you wish to enable IKEv2 functionality, you will have to create an embedded provisioning file in your Apple Developer account and use it in the engine project (See 'embedded.provisionprofile' in backend/engine/engine.pro).
